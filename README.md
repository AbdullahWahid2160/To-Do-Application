# To-Do-Application
An application which can keep record of user's tasks by adding them to the list and assign separate color to each. User can either delete the completed or pending tasks separately shown in two lists of "To-Do" and "Done" and can mark the pending ones and pluck them out of the "To-Do" list and pushing them to "Done" List of Tasks.
